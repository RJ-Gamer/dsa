## [Unreleased]

### Added

**Grid Pattern**
- `min_distance` — Edit Distance (Levenshtein distance) full grid solution; explains all three operations (delete, insert, replace) with a complete cell-by-cell trace of `"horse" → "ros"`

**Interval Pattern** *(new pattern)*
- `interval_dynamic_programming/README.md` — pattern overview: interval mental model, n×n grid visualization, fill-by-length template, space optimization technique, and comparison with Grid Pattern
- `longest_palindrome_subsequence` — Full Grid and Space-Optimized solutions; explains interval DP fill order, the outer-in matching insight, and full traces for `"bab"` and `"total"`
- `palindromic_substrings` — 3 solutions: Memoized Recursion, Interval DP boolean table, and Expand Around Center (O(1) space); explains substring vs. subsequence distinction, why length-2 is handled separately, and full traces for `"madam"` and `"aaa"`

**Grid Pattern (update)**
- `longest_common_subsequence` — space-optimized O(n) solution using two-row (`prev`/`curr`) technique

- `robber` (House Robber) — tabulated and space-optimized solutions
- `staircase_pattern/README.md` — pattern overview, recurrence template, when-to-use guide

- `unique_paths_obstacles` — single-array space-optimized solution
- `longest_common_subsequence` — DP grid solution with full traced example
- `grid_pattern/README.md` — pattern overview, grid template, space optimization technique

**Repo structure**
- `README.md` — main landing page with badges, pattern map, problem index, optimization journey
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — contribution guide with PR checklist, writing style guide, naming conventions
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file
